      <p class="info1">The Sushruta Samhita, a treatise ascribed to him, is one of the most important surviving ancient treatises on medicine and is considered a foundational text of Ayurveda.The treatise addresses all aspects of general medicine, but the impressive chapters on surgery have led to the false impression that this is its main topic. The translator G. D. Singhal dubbed Sushruta "the father of surgery" on account of these detailed accounts of surgery.</p>
      <p class="info1">The treatise mainly focuses on various surgeries and their methods.It also discuses Vayu,Pitta and Kapha,so-called humours of the body</p>
